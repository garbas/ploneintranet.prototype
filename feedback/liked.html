<form action="/feedback/liked.html" id="functions">
	<!-- The submit button sends a name value pair to the server. The name is always the same but the value differs, depending whether the state is like or unlike. When the user has already liked the item and the form is submitted with the name value pair: like_button/like, then in the server feedback (/feedback/liked.html) the like count will be increased by 1 and the class 'active' is added. When the form is submitted with the name value pair like_button/unlike, the like count in will be decreased by one and the class 'active' is removed from the button. This is all done server side. -->
