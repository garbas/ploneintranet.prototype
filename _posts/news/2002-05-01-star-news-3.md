Osamu Shinobe, President and CEO of ANA, said: "We are pleased to welcome Ethiopian Airlines which has the largest network in Africa as our codeshare partner and look forward to working together to bring our customers greater choice and convenience across our combined Japanese and African networks."

Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO, Tewolde Gebremariam, said: ”I wish to thank ANA, a fellow Star Alliance member, for this mutually beneficial codeshare partnership. Our codeshare partnership will give our customers traveling between Africa and Japan the best possible connectivity options with one ticket and one single check in at first boarding airport. It will also play a critical role in enabling greater people-to-people, investment, trade and tourism ties between a rising Africa, the second fastest growing region in the world, and a highly industrialised Japan, the third largest economy in the world.”
