## Lufthansa’s equity investment time:matters sets new standards with its Liefery delivery service: goods delivered to customers within 90 minutes of ordering online

Since 2014, the delivery service Liefery has been offering a service which delivers products to customers within 90 minutes of their placing an order. The range of products is wide and flexible, from fashion items and food for non-business customers to missing drill bits and screws for construction site workers. The customers specify online or via an app where they want their items to be delivered to. And customers who want their delivery to be made later can specify a 60-minute window for delivery. The costs for the service start at EUR 6.99.

Items can be delivered quickly and punctually because Liefery makes use of retailers and online shops in the city where the customer places their order. This means that local businesses can be given a boost in the growing multichannel retail segment. The service is already available in over 35 German towns and cities. Liefery plans to expand its services to more than 100 German towns and cities by the end of 2015 in response to increasing demand from the partnering retail chains. It is also planning to move into major cities around Europe.

 “Liefery is a good example of how Lufthansa can innovatively grow in new market segments on the periphery of its core business segment. This is having a positive effect on our core business segment – cargo and logistics – and is creating value for our shareholders,” said Sadiq Gillani, Head of Corporate Strategy of the Lufthansa Group.

Liefery came out of the time:matters group, a leading European platform in the dynamic market for ‘same-day delivery’. Lufthansa Cargo holds a 49 per cent stake in time:matters. The Liefery start-up based in Neu-Isenburg benefits from its parent company’s twelve years of experience in the logistics sector. Liefery uses the time:matters network of over 600 courier partners. The service is already used by more than 400 local retail businesses and twelve retail chains.

“The new delivery service makes it easier to shop. It’s a quick and straightforward way to get what you need,” said Franz-Joseph Miller, co-founder and CEO of the time:matters group. “Liefery also gives local businesses a way to provide additional services and to strengthen their position in the market as online shopping continues to boom,” said Miller.
