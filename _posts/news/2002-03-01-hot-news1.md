An Airbus A380 superjumbo operated by Air France (AF) headed to New York’s JFK airport from Paris was forced to turn back to the French capital after severe turbulence in the initial climb phase injured crew members.

Flight AF006 landed normally at 4:26 p.m. local time and medical assistance was made available to passengers and to crew when the airliner arrived at its parking spot, Air France said in an e-mailed statement today.

Air France didn’t say how many people were aboard the plane or how many passengers sought assistance. The A380, built by Airbus Group NV (AIR), is the world’s largest commercial aircraft, and it typically seats about 525 people in three classes spread across two decks.
