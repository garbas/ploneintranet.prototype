Government organisations may need to consider these:

 * Ensure any standing templates are updated to reflect current guidance. Do not assume that previous years’ templates will still be correct
 * Identify and plan the National Audit Office input
 * Executive agencies and other arms-length bodies should prepare annual reports and accounts in accordance with their governing documents, relevant legislation and directions given by parent departments
 * Executive agencies and other arms-length bodies should confirm with their parent department the timelines for approval by the permanent secretary and relevant minsters
 * Obtain a spending controls exemption to produce and publish the report and accounts
 * Combine draft text and financial information
 * Confirm whether the design and layout of the report and accounts will be managed in house or given to an external design agency or typesetter
 * Review and agree on the design and layout of the document
