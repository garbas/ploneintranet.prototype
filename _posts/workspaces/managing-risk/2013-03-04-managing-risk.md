In recent years, all sectors of the economy have focused on risk management as
the key to allowing organisations to successfully deliver their outcomes while
protecting the interests of their stakeholders.  As defined by the Orange Book,
risk is uncertainty of outcome, and good risk management allows an organisation
to:

 * have increased confidence in achieving its desired outcomes
 * effectively constrain threats to acceptable levels and
 * take informed decisions about exploiting opportunities.

Good risk management allows stakeholders to have increased confidence in the
organisation’s corporate governance and ability to deliver.  ‘Information risk’,
however, is often not as visible as it should be, and therefore not always as
well managed.  The pace of technological change in the information age means new
risks can appear quickly, and may not be as visible to Boards as other
risks. Senior staff may wrongly assume information risks (unlike financial risks
or physical threats) are secondary, and of less strategic importance.

The guardianship and management of information in all its aspects (integrity,
availability and confidentiality) is crucial to public service delivery.
