We publish guidance on commonly held public records, where generic disposal
periods can normally be identified.The principles behind records disposal
scheduling are to ensure that:

 * records are kept for as long as they are needed
 * all legitimate considerations have been considered and balanced
 * records are kept or destroyed as appropriate
