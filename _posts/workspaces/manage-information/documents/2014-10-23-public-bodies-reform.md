Government has announced its intention to close or take out of public ownership
192 arm’s-length bodies (ALBs) and to merge a further 118. The process of
reorganising ALBs places information at risk. These risks may be different to
those encountered during ‘business as usual’, and will require careful
management.

Making arrangements for the transfer of information, records and knowledge is a
key part of any Machinery of Government change. It must be properly planned and
adequately resourced. Failure to transfer information and knowledge effectively
can prevent you operating legally, transparently and accountably. It can also
cause inefficiencies and lead to substantial additional cost.
