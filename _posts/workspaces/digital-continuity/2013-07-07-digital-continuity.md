 * Are you confident that your current IT and information management
   infrastructure will enable you to access and use your business critical
   information in the way that you need for as long as you need?
 * Are you going through changes to your organisation, technical environment,
   policies or processes?
 * Are you confident that youâ€™ll still be able to find, open, trust, work with,
   and understand business critical information afterwards?

This day long course is workshop based and covers planning for action and
defining your requirements, assessing and managing the risks and maintaining
digital continuity. We provide attendees with imaginary and real life scenarios
to enhance understanding of digital continuity and how it can apply to every
organisation. It is particularly useful for those working in information and
records management, IT, information assurance and change management.

**When and where**

We are holding digital continuity training on the following dates in 2014. To
reserve a place on one of these courses, please complete our online form. Please
note we are only able to offer places to those within the Public Sector.
