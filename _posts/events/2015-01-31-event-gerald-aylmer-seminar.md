**Friday 31 January 2015**

The <a href="#">Institute of Historical Research</a>, Senate House, London.

Hosted by the Royal Historical Society, the Institute of Historical Research, The National Archives and the British Library.

How do archivists and historians deal with secrets? How do secrets impact family and personal narratives? How do we deal with sensitivities in archiving material, and with sensitivities around difficult periods in national and global history? These are some of the questions that the Gerald Aylmer seminar will aim to address. The programme has three panel sessions with short presentations and open discussion.
