# User Forum

The User Forum is your chance to hear what's happening at The National Archives and to have your say. It is open to all users of our services.

The forum takes place at The National Archives and lasts for approximately one to one and a half hours.

Of the 12 monthly users' meetings per year, eight are User Forum meetings and four are User Advisory Group (UAG) meetings. Normally there is no User Forum in the same month as a UAG meeting.

For more information please contact user.forum@nationalarchives.gsi.gov.uk or phone extension 2238.
