# A Game for Christmas: Football on the Western Front, December 1914?

** 2 December 2014**

## 14:00 Talks Toom

Any mention of football and World War I will bring forth discussions of the Christmas Truce of 1914 and the mythical football match played between British and German troops in No Man's Land. At the time many denied that a truce had occurred, let alone a football match between the combatants. This talk utilises British Army War Diaries, individual soldier's diaries, letters and newspapers to examine how citizen diplomacy apparently subverted the wishes of higher command, at least temporarily, to possibly have allowed some soldiers to enjoy a game for Christmas.

This event is part of our themed programme. Diplomacy is at the heart of all human interaction. Whether between international states and colonies, monarchs and their ministers, the major players in the theatres of war, kith and kin, or friends and enemies: diplomacy - or lack of it - will play its part. This programme of events aims to reflect the broad spectrum of interpretations of historical diplomacy and the art of peace-making.
