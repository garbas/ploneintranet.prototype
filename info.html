	    <p><strong>Plone Social Intranet</strong> combines enterprise web content management, social tools, and portal integration, delivered through an intuitive, mobile-friendly user interface. It’s being built from the ground-up, design-first, using agile software development methodologies.</p>

		<p>The designers, developers, and project managers at the heart of the team have been delivering bespoke intranet solutions for years, to a wide range of customers in major business sectors. Our existing software already provides a wealth of functionality for the digital workplace, to more than 100,000 users worldwide. Now we are consolidating our value into one complete solution, and we’re already yielding economies of scale with this new approach.</p>
