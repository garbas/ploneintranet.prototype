Installation for Developers
===========================

We assume you want to do some work on ploneintranet. Here is what you need
to do to get yourself set up.

* Clone the repository from https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.suite
* Create a virtualenv `virtualenv-2.7 --no-site-packages .`
* Run bootstrap `bin/python-2.7 bootstrap.py
* run buildout `bin/buildout -c dev.cfg`

While we are still in development mode and don't have eggs released, you
  have to make the theme explicitly

**Note**: If you don't have node/npm and ruby/bundler/jekyll available, read
the "Standalone Installation" under
https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.theme/blob/master/README.rst
first.

Then

* cd into src/ploneintranet.theme
* run `make release` to create the compiled theme files within the egg
  (this would be the contents of the theme egg, once built)

**Note**: Everytime you pull ploneintranet.theme again and expect new javascript or any
design changes, you probably need to rerun make clean && make.

* Create a new Plone instance and under `Add-ons`, choose the package `Plone Intranet: Suite`

Specials:
---------

* Currently I have to deactivate simplesharing.js as it throws an error on non-existing dom element and effectively deactivates the other js.
